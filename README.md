# ARISE

This is a repository for the development and validation of ARISE, Algorithmic Risk Inspection for Screening Elevated Lipoprotein(a).

ARISE is an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model for optimizing screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) using 6 commonly available clinical features. It has been developed in the UK Biobank, the largest cohort of individuals (>450,000) with protocolized lipoprotein(a) assessment, and externally validated in established US-based prospective cohort studies of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).
