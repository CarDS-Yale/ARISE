# CarDS Lab Template

Repository Template for CarDS Lab Projects

1. Create new empty repo in github
2. There are 2 main ways of creating a repo that complies with the template.
(i) On Github.com use "Import a repository" while creating a new repository in Cards Lab and use URL "https://github.com/CarDS-Yale/CarDS_lab_template.git"
(ii) If you plan to use git command line or GitHub desktop, recommend creating an empty git repo at CarDS Lab, and download the template to a local folder (and commit via command line or GitHub Desktop)
3. All data should be in a `data_folder` that should be added to .gitignore
